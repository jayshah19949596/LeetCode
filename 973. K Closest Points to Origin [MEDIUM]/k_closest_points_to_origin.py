973. K Closest Points to Origin [MEDIUM]
https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/description/

### 1. Question Explanation:
----------------------------
Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k.
Return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

"""
APPROACH-4: BinarySearch
------------------------------------------------
1. Precompute the Euclidean distances of each point.
2. Define the initial binary search range by identifying the farthest computed distance.
3. Perform a binary search from low to high using the reference distances.
   - Calculate the midpoint of the remaining range as the target distance.
   - Split the remaining points into those closer and those farther than the target distance.
   - If the closer array has fewer than k points, add them to the closest array and adjust the value of k.
   - Keep only the appropriate remaining array for the next iteration and update the binary search range.
4. Once k elements have been added to the closest array, return the k closest points

### Complexity Analysis:
------------------------------------------------
Time Complexity:
Average case: O(N). It achieves this by halving (on average) the remaining elements needing to be processed at each iteration
Worst case: O(N^2) in the worst case.

Space Complexity: O(N). An extra O(N) space is required for the arrays containing distances and reference indices.
